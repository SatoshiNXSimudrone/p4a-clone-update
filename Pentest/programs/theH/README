What is this?
-------------

theHarvester is a tool for gathering e-mail accounts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources (search engines, pgp key servers). 

Is a really simple tool, but very effective for the early stages of a penetration test or just to know the visibility of your company in the Internet.

The actual sources are:

Passive:
--------
google: google search engine  - www.google.com
google-profiles: google search engine, specific search for Google profiles
bing: microsoft search engine  - www.bing.com
bingapi: microsoft search engine, through the API (you need to add your Key in the discovery/bingsearch.py file)
pgp: pgp key server - pgp.rediris.es 
exalead: Exalead search engine  - www.exalead.com
linkedin: google search engine, specific search for Linkedin users
shodan: Shodan Computer search engine, will search for ports and banner of the discovered hosts  (http://www.shodanhq.com/)
vhost: Bing virtual hosts search
google-sets: based on discovered hostnames, the tool can pull recommendations on other names from google SETS.

Active:
-------
DNS brute force: this plugin will run a dictionary brute force enumeration
